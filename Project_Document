::: Project Title :::
Enhanced Breast Cancer Risk Assessment through Machine Learning and Feature Analysis

::: Project Description :::

Accurate breast cancer risk assessment is essential for informed clinical decision-making.
This project develops and evaluates machine learning models to enhance the prediction of breast cancer risk.
We explore the potential of these models to provide clinicians with a valuable tool for improved risk stratification,
personalized treatment plans, and ultimately, better patient outcomes.

::: Frameworks and Functions Used:::

1. Imported Libraries
    * pandas, numpy - To read the dataset, to handle numerical data
    * matplotlib, seaborn - For Data Visualization
    * scikit-learn (sklearn- For preprocessing, feature selection,
      model selection, model inspection and model metrics)

2. Data Preprocessing
    * Fill null values by imputing with Median value
    * Converted Column values to numeric (if any)
    * Dropped the non required column

3. Data Preparation
    * Separated the features (X) and target variable (y)
    * Converts the target variable to binary (0 and 1)
    * Splits the data into training and testing sets
    * Feature scaling using StandardScaler

4. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
    * Descriptive Statistics on the standardized data
    * Visualize the data distribution, feature relationships and class imbalance
        - the boxplot, heatmap, count plot and column graph

5. Feature Selection
    * Uses Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE) with a RandomForestClassifier
    to select the top 5 most important features.

6. Model Training and Evaluation
    * Trains and evaluates multiple machine learning models
      (Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, SVM, K-Nearest Neighbors, Decision Tree).
    * For each model, it calculates accuracy, generates a classification report,
      creates a confusion matrix, calculates ROC curve and AUC.

7. Model Comparison
    * Compares the performance of the trained models based on accuracy.

8. Model Interpretation
    * Calculates and plots permutation importance for the best performing model.
      This helps identify the most influential features.
